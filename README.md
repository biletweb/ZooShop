# online store in python
This is my hands-on Python course that contains everything I've learned from online courses. Implemented an online store with product categories, product details, product search, user profiles, user registration and authorization, product comments, product likes and dislikes, shopping cart and checkout. All this is implemented on the django framework. To install the required libraries, use the requirements.txt file in the root of the main project directory.
