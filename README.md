# Online store in python
This is my hands-on Python course that contains everything I've learned from online courses. Created an online store with:

<ul>
<li>product categories</li>
<li>product details</li>
<li>product search</li>
<li>user registration and authorization</li>
<li>user profiles</li>
<li>product comments</li>
<li>product likes and dislikes</li>
<li>shopping cart and checkout, and many other functions</li>
</ul>

The online store is implemented on the django framework. To install the required libraries, use the requirements.txt file in the root of the main project directory.
After installing the required libraries from the requirements.txt file, run the following commands in the terminal:

<ul>
<li>python manage.py makemigrations</li>
<li>python manage.py migrate</li>
<li>python manage.py createsuperuser</li>
<li>python manage.py runserver</li>
</ul>
